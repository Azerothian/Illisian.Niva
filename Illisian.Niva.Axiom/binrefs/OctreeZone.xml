            <remarks>
            	This method allows a Renderable to map in a custom GPU program parameter
            	based on it's own data. This is represented by a GPU auto parameter
            	of AutoConstantType.Custom, and to allow there to be more than one of these per
            	Renderable, the 'data' field on the auto parameter will identify
            	which parameter is being updated. The implementation of this method
            	must identify the parameter being updated, and call a 'SetConstant'
            	method on the passed in <see cref="T:Axiom.Graphics.GpuProgramParameters"/> object, using the details
            	provided in the incoming auto constant setting to identify the index

            </summary>
            <remarks>
               When a renderable uses vertex blending, it uses multiple world matrices instead of a single
               one. Each vertex sent to the pipeline can reference one or more matrices in this list
               with given weights.
               If a renderable does not use vertex blending this method returns 1, which is the default for
               simplicity.

            <remarks>
               Usually IRenderable objects will use a projection matrix as determined
               by the active camera. However, if they want they can cancel this out
               and use an identity projection, which effectively projects in 2D using
               a {-1, 1} view space. Useful for overlay rendering. Normal renderables need
               not override this.

            <remarks>
               Usually IRenderable objects will use a view matrix as determined
               by the active camera. However, if they want they can cancel this out
               and use an identity matrix, which means all geometry is assumed
               to be relative to camera space already. Useful for overlay rendering.
               Normal renderables need not override this.
